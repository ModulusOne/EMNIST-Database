# EMNIST-Database
An EMNIST database i created in CSV format (converted from a 28x28 pixel image)

I struggled to find alphabetical characters dataset in csv format ready for input into a neural network so i thought id make my own using a few images of handwritten characters i found online (forgive me as i cant find the source at the moment)

I will also add the code in which i used to convert the images into 28x28 from their original size (alot bigger)
and i will also add the code to turn the images into a csv file
